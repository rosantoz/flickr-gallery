PHP / Jquery Flickr Gallery
=======================

A simple Flickr image gallery.

The user enters a keyword, which is then used to search Flickr.

The search results are paginated and displayed as five results per page,
and the user is able to navigate to other pages. Each image is displayed as a thumbnail;
clicking on the thumbnail opens a modal window which shows the image in larger scale.
